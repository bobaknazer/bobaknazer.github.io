    "content": "It is becoming increasingly clear that the next generation of engineers will need to draw upon concepts and techniques from probability and statistics to tackle the challenges posed by uncertain, complex systems and large, high-dimensional data sets. This course is intended to give all engineering students a strong foundation in probability and statistics as well as an introduction to ideas from data analytics and machine learning. Any student that successfully completes this course will be well-prepared to take upper-electives in machine learning, data analytics, random processes, as well as any other course that draws heavily upon probabilistic reasoning.

(Acceleration is 4x for concepts and definitions, 2x for detailed examples). | Each video introduces a concept and works through one or two basic examples in detail. The content is essentially identical to what would be written on the chalkboard/whiteboard in a traditional lecture. PDFs for each completed “board” are made available alongside each video. | The videos move faster than a traditional lecture, which makes note-taking unrealistic. To compensate, detailed handouts with key definitions and formulas are made available in advance. | In-person lectures build on the videos by developing deeper intuition, studying real-life applications and datasets, and working through complex examples. | To recover the time spent outside the classroom watching videos, some part of the lecture is devoted solving homework problems, with guidance from the instructor and teaching fellows. | Colors are used to highlight and connect concepts. | Videos are permanently available on YouTube to serve as review material for subsequent courses. | .

Creating each video is a time-consuming process. Here is the overall workflow: . | Plan out the video. Specifically, make a draft document with all equations and examples in order to avoid typos and other mistakes. | Carefully and slowly write out the text and equations as well as the illustrations in the Explain Everything App. (Make many backups along the way.) | After all of the content has been added, delete the time gaps between pen strokes so that the writing flows smoothly. | Export the video as well as the corresponding PDF slides. (For the video, use the Explain Everything Compressor on the iMac rather than exporting directly from the iPad app.) | Using Adobe Premiere Pro, accelerate the concepts and definitions by 4x and the examples by 2x. Export the resulting accelerated video. | Using the iPad, display the PDF slides, and, on the iMac, open the accelerated video in QuickTime. | Play the video in QuickTime while making a screen recording and narrating into the microphone. Use the space button on a keyboard to pause the video to maintain synchronization. Prepare for upcoming content using the the PDF slides on the iPad. | Balance audio and complete final video edits in Adobe Premiere Pro. | Export to YouTube format and upload. | . ",
